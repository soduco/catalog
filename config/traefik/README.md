# Traefik config

The ssl folder contains certificates for https
The ssl_old (if present, it is generated by the script generate) is a ssl folder copy, in case we need to revert to old certificates after manual renewal

folder contents is empty for security reason (we obviously don't want our private key on a github repo)

traefik.yml contain generals configs
traefik-config.yml contain ssl certificates emplacements
