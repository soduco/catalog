### Datasets and ressources

data is published in units called “datasets”.
CKAN can store the resource internally or as a link.

N.B.: "Package" (used in earlier versions) has exactly the same meaning as “dataset”.

harvest pas natif, mais existe des extensions (ex: https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-harvest)
