# ISO 19115-3:2016

## Scope

This document defines an integrated XML implementation of ISO 19115-1, ISO 19115-2, and concepts from ISO/TS 19139 by defining the following artefacts:
- a set of XML schema required to validate metadata instance documents conforming to conceptual model elements defined in ISO 19115‑1, ISO 19115‑2, and ISO/TS 19139;
- a set of ISO/IEC 19757‑3 (Schematron) rules that implement validation constraints in the ISO 19115‑1 and ISO 19115‑2 UML models that are not validated by the XML schema;
- an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) for transforming ISO 19115-1 metadata encoded using the ISO/TS 19139 XML schema and ISO 19115‑2 metadata encoded using the ISO/TS 19139‑2 XML schema into an equivalent document that is valid against the XML schema defined in this document.
