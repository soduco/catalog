Rework of the precedent proxy for more flexibility

CKAN folder wasn't imported, because it's already a git folder (should have initialized it as git submodule)
CKAN currently not working

Geonetwork file store currently not working (saving files but not possible to access them afterward)

TODO :
 - copy ckan/contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml
 - remove CKAN folder
 - instantiate it as submodule
 - paste ckan/contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml
