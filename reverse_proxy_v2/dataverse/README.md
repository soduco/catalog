# "Archive in the box" distributive for Dataverse
This distributive is intented for the research organizations and universities which want to run Community based Data Repository to make their data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). The idea of having "archive in the box" is simple: it should be doing an automatic installation and setting up the complete infrastructure without extra efforts and by institutions having limited technical resources. You can easily turn this demonstration service with default FAKE persistent identifiers into completely operational data archive with production DOIs, mail relay and automatically connected external storages. 

## Dataverse Docker module
Dataverse Docker module was developed by [DANS-KNAW](http://dans.knaw.nl) (Data Archiving and Networked Services, the Netherlands) to run [Dataverse](http://github.com/IQSS/dataverse) data repository on Kubernetes and other Cloud services supporting Docker.
Current available version of [Dataverse](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse) in the Docker module is 5.8. The development of Docker module funded by [SSHOC](https://sshopencloud.eu/) project that will create the social sciences and humanities area of the European Open Science Cloud [EOSC](https://www.eosc.eu).

### Main features
- fully automatic Dataverse deployment with Traefik proxy
- Dataverse configuration managed through environmental file .env
- external controlled vocabularies support (demo of CESSDA CMM metadata fields connected to Skosmos framework)
- MinIO storage support
- data previewers integrated in the distributive
- startup process managed through scripts located in init.d folder 
- automatic SOLR reindex 
- external services integration PostgreSQL triggers
- support of custom metadata schemes (CESSDA CMM, CLARIN CMDI, ...)

### Installation

Dataverse Docker module v5.8 uses Træfik, a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. Træfik integrates with your existing infrastructure components (Docker, Swarm mode, Kubernetes, Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Rancher, Amazon ECS, ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.

You need to specify the value of "traefikhost" and pub your domain name there (for example, sshopencloud.eu or just localhost) before you'll start to deploy Dataverse infrastructure:

```export traefikhost=localhost``` OR ```export traefikhost=sshopencloud.eu```

and create docker network for all the containers you would expose on the web

```docker network create traefik```

By default you'll get SSL certificate provided by letsencrypt, please specify your email address if you need https support, for example:

```export useremail=team@mydataverse.org```

* Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed
* Run `docker-compose up` to start Dataverse on your domain name with SSL support
or 
* run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up` to try Dataverse on localhost

Standalone Dataverse should be running on dataverse-dev.localhost or dataverse-dev.sshopencloud.eu if you've selected the domain.

Default user/password: dataverseAdmin/admin and after you should change it.

Check if Dataverse is already available:
```curl http://localhost:8080```

If it's not coming up please check if all required containers are up: `docker ps`

```
