Important note from Geonetwork (from logs at start):

>Password database encryptor initialized - Keep the file /var/lib/jetty/webapps/geonetwork/WEB-INF/data/config/encryptor.properties safe and make a backup. When upgrading to a newer version of GeoNetwork the file must be restored, otherwise GeoNetwork will not be able to decrypt passwords already stored in the database.
